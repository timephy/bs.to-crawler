# bs.to-crawler
A web crawler that extracts video urls from [bs.to](https://bs.to) in bulk.

## Attention - This project does not work in the current state

bs.to regocnized automation since javascript property `navigator.webdriver` is set to `true`.
Overriding this property with javascript code (e.g. Object.defineProperty) does sort of work, but then one would have to solve an near infinite amount of CAPTCHAs.

There **is** a [possible fix](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42169488/how-to-make-chromedriver-undetectable)
(version rollback to pre-Oct-2017, *very tedious*).

## Requirements

- python3.6 https://www.python.org/downloads/
- chromedriver https://chromedriver.chromium.org
- beautifulsoup4 `pip3.6 install beautifulsoup4`
- selenium `pip3.6 install selenium`
- requests `pip3.6 install requests`
- wget (only for downloading the videos)


## Getting started

1. Visit [bs.to](https://bs.to) and select your desired series (including season and language). Copy the URL in the top bar of your browser (Should be of this form: `http://bs.to/serie/<series>/<season>/<language>`, e.g. `https://bs.to/serie/Downton-Abbey/1/en`).
2. Run the program in the command-line: `python3.6 . [URL]`
3. Get video links from the output file(s)!


## Please note

- Currently only one host ([vivo.sx](https://vivo.sx)) is supported!

- Hosts like vivo **change** the video URLs frequently, so the links given only stay valid for a few hours.

- **Windows users**: Please user `Git Bash`/`PowerShell` instead of `cmd`!


## How it works

This tool uses selenium to parse and query html. It uses chromedriver to control a Chrome browser instance. This simulates a real user and browser. Conveniently this also allows **you** to solve the CAPTCHAs.
