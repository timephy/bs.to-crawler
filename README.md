# bs.to-crawler
A web crawler that extracts video urls from [bs.to](https://bs.to) in bulk.


## Requirements

- python3.8 https://www.python.org/downloads/
- chromedriver https://chromedriver.chromium.org
- beautifulsoup4 `pip3.8 install beautifulsoup4`
- selenium `pip3.8 install selenium`
- requests `pip3.8 install requests`


## Getting started

1. Visit [bs.to](https://bs.to) and select your desired series (with season and language). Copy the URL in the top bar of your browser (Should be of this form: `http://bs.to/serie/<series>/<season>/<language>`, e.g. `https://bs.to/serie/Downton-Abbey/1/en`).
2. Run the program in the command-line: `python3.8 . [URL]`
3. Get video links from the output file!


## How it works

This tool uses selenium to parse and query html. It uses chromedriver to control a Chrome browser instance. This simulates a real user and browser. Conveniently this also allows *you* to solve the CAPTCHAs.
